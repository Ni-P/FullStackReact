# Emaily

This is a simple app that allows users to send survey emails to an email list and get back feedback from the recipients.
It's built using the MERN stack and Redux.

## Usage

Users login using a Google account through Google OAuth. 
Users can then buy credit using a credit card with Stripe. 
After buying credit users can create surveys, which ask the recipients to select "yes" or "no" in the email.
The response is then saved and the total number of responses are show to the user.
